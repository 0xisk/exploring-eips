# EIP-196: Precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128 

ðŸ”— https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-196

---

##  Simple Summary
This EIP suggests to add precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on a specific pairing-friendly elliptic curve. This can in turn be combined with EIP-197 to verify zkSNARKs in Ethereum smart contracts. The general benefit of zkSNARKs for Ethereum is that it will increase the privacy for users (because of the Zero-Knowledge property) and might also be a scalability solution (because of the succinctness and efficient verifiability property).
