# ECIP 1025: Precompiled Contracts for zkSNARK Verification 

ðŸ”— https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1025

---

##  Simple Summary
zkSNARK verification will allow anonymous transaction to be executed on the Ethereum Classic network. See this for how a simple mixer contract can be implemented using zkSNARK verification. This ECIP implements three primitive operations in order to perform zkSNARK verification. This allows changes of zkSNARK algorithms without requiring another hard fork.

The general benefit of zkSNARKs for Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is that it will increase the privacy for users (because of the Zero-Knowledge property) and might also be a scalability solution (because of the succinctness and efficient verifiability property).
